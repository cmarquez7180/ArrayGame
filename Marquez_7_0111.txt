I will create a slick game that has a skeleton as a protaginist, and 
has to go collect bones from around the maze that dogs/wolfs have
stolen from him. If the dog touches him however he will be eaten.
because dogs love bones

It would be cool that the more bones he has the faster he gets because 
those are his bones, and as he gains more bones he is becoming a more
complete person.
