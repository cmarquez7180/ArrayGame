1. I am ready to begin coding
2. I just don't know how to begin coding
3. My biggest challenges will be my lack of knowledge, experience, and confidence
4. This is a challenge, because I never feel happy when writing code, because I'm 
confused. I know I will learn to though as the year progresses, because I have 
learned a lot so far. It just gonna take more projects to learn. As of now I will 
just try to learn what I need to know for this project.
