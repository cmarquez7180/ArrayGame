10 Questions I had when adding orbs to my game:
-How do you start?
-Should I be adding this in the Player or Orb class?
	public void setDirection(int i){
	this.direction = i;
-Should I be referencing the orb or players direction?
	ball.setX(int)skully.x);
	ball.setDirection() == 5 {
-Why won't time exists work?
	I set it up in orb class
		public void countdown(){
		   this.timeexists --;
	The I called it in the game class
		ball.settimeexists(100);
	*This one still doesn't work today*
-How do you set up countdown()?
-How do you reduse the size of the orb?
	*Still a problem*
-How to create a loop for enemies? Would it be similar
 to the object for loop?
-How to solve the Player not being opened in lose&win
 class?
	Since the Player is no longer static
	Player.health = 1000000; & Player.speed = 4.f;
	no longer work
-How would you tell the game to travel to another level?
	*Still a question*
	Would you create an if else statement that would
	go to lvl 2 if lvl 1 completed?
-My enemies are very "Shaky" how would you fix that?
	I don't think theres anything wrong with the 
	sprite sheet, but they just don't walk nicely
