Creativity is a process that starts with thinking for yourself. The whole idea behind being creative is
being unique from ever other project or person out there. To be start to be creative you first have to 
realize your problem, and brainstorm multiple ideas to solve the problem. Without brainstorming you 
won't be able to start to solve the problem. Then you have to think of better ways to solve problems, 
and solve it. Try not to research so much, because you may end up copying an idea. Istead try looking 
at things not related to the project, and come up with ideas through that. Creativity happens before the
project starts, and allows you to build a unique project.
