I think I was pretty sucessful for my game, because I had everything 
that was required, and I actually knew what I was doing. Usually when
I am doing something in this class I am confused the whole time, and 
I miss things. I was successfully able to have a gamer submit a name,
go on a journey for a day, can a game in the game, and when you lose 
the gamer is given the option to play again.
