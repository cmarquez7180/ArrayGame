Ballmer called GPL a virus, because Linux attached its licenses to programs and it spreads.It is required for a 
user that used open source software to (When they finishtheir software) to then give it as an open source 
software. Even if they created new portions, they still have to license off as open source software. 

Proprietary software has limits against use, and is copyrighted. You do not have as much freedoms as you do for 
open source software. Open source software gives the user the ability to change the code of a program however 
they please.

GPL is a license that gives users permission to change/use an open-source software as long as you re-distribute
the changed versions to GPL. MIT can me manipulated in anyway as long as recieved under the license
