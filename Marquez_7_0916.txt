Three guidelines/principles for this class are:
1. Tinker- You're not helping youself if you just sit there
2. Helping others helps you- If you can evplain something to someone, you're going over the information too, and getting
   better by helping them
3. NO hand-held electronics allowed- studies prove electronics distract students, and causes them to have lower grades
WHY?
If you're following these rules then you should look organized, and understand your surroundings. 

If a command is not working check the error bars that most of the time tell you what's wrong (IBS), and then ask 
someone next to you to see what's wrong

If a student encounters a problem they should a)refer to their notes b) Think about how you got into the problem, 
did you save earlier that way you can just go back? If not google the problem, or ask around to see if this
happened to other people odds are you are not the only one who has had this problem, solve the problem, 
understand how you got into this problem, so you don't have to do it again.

The underlying motivation for this process is that you have an organized method to solve any problem 

Perkins said there's two types of people; Movers and stoppers. Don't stop and wait for the teacher, mess around, and 
see if you can solve it on your own
