Assembly is a new language of computer science (Compared to Java)

Assembly is good for programs that the programmer needs full 
control over the systems hardware need to give certain tasks such
as writing device drivers, operating system design, embedded 
systems programming. 

Assembly is different from Java in that it is considered a "lower
level languange." Also it is more difficult to learn Assembly 
than it is to learn Java. Assembly is not portable, but gives 
more capability in controlling a program.

High-level Language:
-Common Applications
-Program Developing is faster
-Fewer lines of code
-maintenace is easier
Low-level Language:
-Programs are not portable
-More difficult language
-Program assembly is tedious and error prone

Java is a High-level language. I know this because it is portable
(Can share program through zip drive), there are libraries and 
condensed code forms 

Assembly is a Low-level language, I know this because the language
is more difficult to learn, and the programs are not portable.
