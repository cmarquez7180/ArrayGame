The dunegon will be completly pitch black, and the playyer will be told what 
to do by descriptions thats happening

Incase that doesn't work out though, I also really like those ball games 
where you just jump over things, and I feel like that would be very fun. And 
they could miss a step and instead of dying they go to a dungen! I feel like 
since I like these kinds of games other people will too.
