My work plan that allowed me to complete my game on time was coming for
tutoring during the day, or staying after for a couple minutes to wrap 
up a little more. I did not do this project outside of class, but I also
finished my Map, and characters before the break which helped A LOT! I 
also could not have finished with out the help of Mr. Davis, Mr. Vidal 
or Zack. Asking for help was something I did that was great. Also while
I was waiting for help I would work on my lose screen or main screen
which worked out nicely.
