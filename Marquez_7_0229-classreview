1. To make a class at the beginning of code you input the phrase
   public class Donut {

   }
2. Donut Bismark = new Donut (); is not a class constructor, because a 
   class constructor is a method inside of a class that allows you to 
   set the variables of that class outside the class, and it is how you 
   create instances of that class. 
   This code uses a class constructor to create an instance


   public class Donut {
	int x,y;
	boolean isGlazed;
	boolean hasJelly;
	float temperature;
(this is just setting up)
	public Donut (boolean a, boolean b, float c){- class constructor
	this.isGlazed = a;
	this.hasJelly = b;
	this.temperature = c;

	}
}
		//a getter gets, i.e., returns a variable value (public 
		to get a private value
3. To make a class with values you have to initialize it, you do this by
   
4. A getter gets, i.e., returns a variable value/ usually a getter is a 
   public method to get a private value
	public boolean getHasJelly () {
        	return this.hasJelly;
	}
5. A setter sets a value, but you do not get anything. Only states a 
   a value
   public void setTemperature (float c) {
	this.temperature = c;

   } 
6. Array of Breafast
   int [] coolnumberz; //this is an array of integers
   String [] coolwords; //this is a string array
   boolean [][] blocked; //2D array of booleans
