An array is an ordered list containing one data type

String name = new String;

String [10][10] name = new String [10][10];

String [10][10][10] name = new String [10][10][10];

public static int a = 2;
String [10] oned = new String [10];
	for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
		oned [a] = "a";
		oned [i] = "0";
}

while (love = true){

}
While is a continous loop that repeats itself over and over until not true
this saves the programmer tons of time, becasue they don't have to repeat
themselves. 

call the game by: method.game

It was reccomended to use .LowerCase() with the scanner input, because
if the user doesn't capitalize their N, which they mostly likely won't
the game can still recognize the function being asked.

You should use different methods to move the protagonist then checking for 
intersections, because intersections would be an if statement while moving
will be an if else statement. 
+ intersections is a method that involves the while loop, nothing else. 

Passing through methods I will have the values of the @, the 
treasure chest, the enemy, and the trap coordinates.
