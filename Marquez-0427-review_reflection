Students are encouraged to learn CS, because in CS we learn problem solving
skills. The goal is not to learn how to set up an orb, but instead how to
set up an object or anything to function in the same way. Also to take how
this functions and change to be used in a different way. 

Students should learn how to combat a problem in CS and to use prior 
knowledge and how to apply it to a future problem.
