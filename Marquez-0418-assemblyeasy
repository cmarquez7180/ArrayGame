The computational reason to type elf64 is so the program knows what
size to make the file

We used ld to load the program

We use chmod to make sample executable because at the begining we
needed to establish that the program was executable. 


In order to get the program to work I had to change the data size

Assembly is not quick and easy, but rather long and tediuos. You 
have to type everything rather than pre-libraires like java

'low level' just means you're seeing more, not that it's easy
or simple.
