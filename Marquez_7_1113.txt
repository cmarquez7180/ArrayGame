I will use while loops in my game, so that after a player gives a certain response the while 
loop will take them to a certain static void without the whileloop the game will not continue 
to move on, and would be kind of disabled from being an actual game

Methods are used in my game to hold different scanners and questions that the players are 
going to be asked to answer.
