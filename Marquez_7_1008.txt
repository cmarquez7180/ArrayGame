I want my project to have a gradient as the backgroud with cirlces that have different color strokes, but do not have a fill
I will use color, and size methods
I can put the circles in a loop, so they keep repeating
If the cirlces blue put somewhere, else  put somewhere else
I will see which  sizes would be best  to go in certain locations
