I cannot see my grade at the moment, but I'm going to assume
I got a 37

I missed a lot of question, because I forgot what the 
defintion of a class constructor, Array, setter, and getter

I could have remembered there was an assesement and studied

If I was successful it would probably be from understanding
the material.
