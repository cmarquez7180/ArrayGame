X-coordinate: 42
Y-coordinate: 67

Line #a sets up a value for when i, the y-coordinate, equals zero which

Line #b is telling the system to print out the array of i and j, with the
characteristics of the defined i and j

Line #c is saying that when there is not a specific coordinate given by 
i or j the system will print out a ".". This is different then #e because
#e is inside another if statement that is saying if i = 0; while the #c is
printing if i!= 0;

Line #d is telling the game to print out the map of the array [i][j]
