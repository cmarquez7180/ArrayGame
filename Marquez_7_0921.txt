I have recieved credit for all my journals thus far in the class. It is important to have a naming convention for a file, so finding the file is easily accessable.
 If every person named thier file differently then Mr. Davis would have to spend a really long time looking at everyone's repository. 

To copy in Linux you use the command "cp"
To copy all of a directory use "cp *"

then where every you want to bring the file to.
