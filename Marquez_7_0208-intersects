I would check to see whether weapons have damaged enemies or objects in
Slick by establishing a boolean to tell if the object has interacted 
with a players hitbox, and if it has then the ememies health decreases 
by a percentage or number. You could also establish a counter that shows 
the player what the health of a certain enemy is.
