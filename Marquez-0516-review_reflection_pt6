Upcasting is converting data types easily, using values acceptable for both

Downcasting is having to change one type in order to properly convert the 
datatypes to eachother

		Upcasting
int meow = 4;
double cat;
cat= meow;
		Downcasting
double woof = 6.52155;
int dog;
i= (int)gog;

		Char to a String
char neigh = 'neigh';
String horse;
horse "" + neigh;

		Range of a byte
-128 to 127
because they work on a system of two's complement (8-binary digits)
