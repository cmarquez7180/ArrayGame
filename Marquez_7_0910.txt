Yesterday we set up a git directory for ourselves, so imputing programs, and journals will be easier
The steps we take everytime we do this is as following

IN KONSOLE
cd Marquez_7_journals
nano Marquez_7_0910 (date)
"Write journal"
control-x to save journal
git add *
git commit -m "Title"
push--u origin master 
boom you're done!
