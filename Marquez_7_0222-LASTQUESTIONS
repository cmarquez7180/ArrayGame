I personally do not feel ready for this test on Friday, but I never
feel ready for anything in CS, and I never feel readyfor any tests.
I don't really have any questions at the moment on the Slick Game
1. Multiple levels- I think I know how to get that started
2. Enemies- done
3.Traps- I have no idea how to start that. Maybe give a coordinate 
for a block tile and have that block tile unblocked, but when is true
or hit then it will do damage to the player. like a hole or grave
4.Give and take damage- when the hit box is touched then the health 
decreases
5.Score- Like a counter? I have that. A score really wouldn't make sense
6.Inventory- I could have a certain amount of orbs being used then make 
other types of weapons

I will need to use arrays, and think a lot. I think I can do it. I will 
do as much as I can and see how long I can go until I reach a problem.
