Slick game is dogs stole bones, and the skeleton has to take them back
without gettig eaten. Collect them all = win
I was done with my sprites and map, but I had a problem with making my
enemies move which set me back for days!
I was not able to meet the deadline, but in the spare time I was waiting
for a question to be answered I made a title screen which is kind of 
productive, and technically ahead, so I actually did make the deadline
