To clean my game to make it more my own I would delete classes, and 
methods that dont pertain to my game. Like the Items, and Arrays that
the original game was using (Ogar, potion, antedote) aspects of the 
game. Also deleting unnessary code (commented out) would allow the 
game to appear cleaner.
