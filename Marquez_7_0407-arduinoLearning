I did not know that there were libraries in Arduino just like Netbeans. I 
thought Arduino was more individualized, but useful libraries are 
available all over the internet. I also learned how one misplacement in a 
curcuit will cause the whole curcuit to malfunction or just not work as 
well as it should (the light will not follow code properly etc.). When we 
began this project we had an idea that seemed very difficult (cueing the 
lights to function at different times when the sensor was activated from 
a certain distance, but as we established our code we saw that conducting 
the lights to go off at certain distances was possible.
