Java function to return cubed value of some number:

public cube(int a) {
	a * a * a = b;
return b; 

} 

Arduino function to return cubed value of some number:

int cube() {
	cube * cube * cube = cubed;
return cubed;
}


Class, object, class constructor- student:

public Student(int a, int b) {
this.x=a;
this.y=b;
this.isVisible=true;
}
Student me = new Student (100,50);
Student you = new Student (0,0);


If we were to continue with the Arduino project I would add a buzzer that
would make noise at a certain volume when an object is x distance away.
(The closer the object the louder the sound) similar to an alarm. This
way there are two sistems of measurement from the sensor and it sends
information to the LED's and the buzzer.
