Arrays are used to hold a fixed number of values of a single data type

The code for an int array is 
int[] intArray = new int [3];
intArray[0] = 1;
intArray[1] = 2;
intArray[2] = 3;
The code for a String array is 
String value = grassMap.getTileProperty(tileID, "blocked", "false");
String [] donuts = {"maple","bismark","berliner"}

The code for a boolean array is 
Blocked.blocked = new boolean [grassMap.getWidth()][grassMap.getHeight()];

The code for a double array is
double [] marble = {".65355", ".5512"}

You would change the first value of the int array to 42 by changing the 
fixed value to intArray[0] = 42;


To change the string array to "Bob" you would change the String [] Bob = 

The code private String[] dessert = new String[3]; calls the 3rd sequence in 
the string

The code private String[] postres = {"rice pudding", "pan dulce", "bunelos"}
sets up the sequences of the String

The two codes are different because one is setting up which String will be
printed and the other is setting up the strings in order of being printed

You would replace "bunuelos" with "apple pie" by 
{"rice pudding","pan dulce","apple pie"}
