The purpose of the code art I created was to play around with the knowledge given to me.
This project was very hard, and it really shouldn't have been. Mr. Davis went over what
were supposed to do, and gave us examples, but if he kept teaching and went on until the 
project was difficult, I would have never been able to do it. By doing little projects 
to test our knowledge it forces us to apply what we know. Without learning what I can do
I would never be able to grow, because I would be too overwhelmsed.

We learned to create code art, so we can grow and learn new ways to make new things. We 
learn to be unique, but still accoplish a task. evey student was given the same materials, 
but no ones projects looks similar at all. There's millions of solutions to a problem, 
and that's one thing we're supposed to learn.
