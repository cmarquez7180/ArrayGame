To add an image to a slick game you start by creating an object 
ie: public Image startimage; then in an init method tell the 
game where to get the image ie: startimage = new Image 
("res/bubble.png");

The image is drawn with .draw() in the render method, staring 
with the 0, 0 coordinate in the top left corner.
