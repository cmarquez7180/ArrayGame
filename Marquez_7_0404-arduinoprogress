We are waiting for a piece to come in that is required for our project.

We need for the piece to come in, and then we can work on the project
from there

I'm sure we'll be able to turn in the project by Friday

The code changes are going to be to the example # 11

The functions we have created will allow the ultrasonic sensor be compatable
and send information to the Arduino board.
