This was honestly the most I've ever understood a project in here. I was 
actually solving most of the problems by myself, or I knew what I needed
to do, but was just missing something to execute it. THE SECOND PART 
HOWEVER was absolutely terrible I have no idea what I am doing. I don't 
even know how to begin. There is just too much and I honeslty don't even 
know where to start, because as soon as I start I run into a problem. Can
we please just forget the second part. I just don't understand. Why I don't 
understand: I don't practice code for fun, I don't fully understand what I 
am being asked. 

1. How would one create a 2d array?
2. What classifies an object as an object?
3. Why would it be beneficial to make your hero a class?
4. What is the use of a method?
5. Give an example of a class constuctor?
6. Why would it be beneficial to have a while loop?
7. Why wouldn't be beneficial to have a while loop?
8. Why would a String array be more beneficial than an int array?
9. Where do you initialize an object?
10. Why would you want multiple enemy classes?
