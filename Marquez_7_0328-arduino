Some similarities I have found in Arduino is the use of loops. I have
also noticed the use of arrays. I have not seen if statements however.

We will make some similar if statement to a noise sounding at a 
certain pitch if a wireless adapter is x distance away.

A ground- negative wire is required for circuits.

Programs are compiled in arduino by being uploaded to the Arduino's 
flash storage. 

The projects we have completed this past week have produced a fundamental
base for what is to be required in this project and Arduino in general. 
Using different circuits with LED's, buzzers, thermometers, etc. allowed
me to see what certain things are possible with these boards. I also 
learned certain rules that are functioning throughout all curcuits (Has 
to be closed, needs ground charge, etc.). Without this week I would not
have been able to even start this project. These examples got me familar
with the boards, and allows me to continue to grow. 

We have went through the entire book which I think is pretty amazing.

Our project will include having an ultrasonic sensor that will send the 
distance of the user holding it, and when the person come a certain 
distance from the board, a light will come on and so will a sound.
